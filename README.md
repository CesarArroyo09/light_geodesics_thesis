# light_geodesics_thesis
This repository contains the calculations of light shift using the formula obtained by Merlin and Salgado.

To run the program write in the terminal:
make scale_factor
./scale_factor.x

This produces a data file with the scale factor as a function of cosmic and conformal time. Cosmic time corresponds to the first column, conformal time to the second column and the third column corresponds to the scale factor.
